    covers (0-50 x 0-25) and the second rank (50-100 x 0-25). Each rank's SharedGrid contains buffers of a specified

    (50-52 x 0-25) in rank 2, and rank 2 buffers (48-50 x 0-25) in rank 1. Be sure to specify a buffer size appropriate
    to any agent behavior. For example, if an agent can "see" 3 units away and take some action based on what it
    perceives, then the buffer size should be at least 3, insuring that an agent can properly see beyond the borders of
