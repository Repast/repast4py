== Overview
The Rumor model is a simple network model that illustrates repast4py's network 
agent-based model features. The simulation models the spread of a rumor through a networked population.
During initialization some number of agents (network nodes) are marked as rumor spreaders. At each iteration of the simulation, a random draw is made to determine if the neighbors of any rumor-spreading nodes have received the rumor. This draw is performed once for each neighbor. After all of the neighbors that can receive the rumor have been processed, the collection of rumor spreaders is updated to include those nodes that received the rumor.

The source code for the examples models can be downloaded from TODO: update link [here].

See TODO: guide link for a complete tutorial using this model.
