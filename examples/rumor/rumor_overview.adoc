The Rumor model is a simple network model that illustrates repast4py's network 
agent-based model features. The simulation models the spread of a rumor through a networked population.
During initialization some number of agents (network nodes) are marked as rumor spreaders. Then at each iteration of the model: 

1. A random draw is made to determine if the network neighbors of any rumor-spreading nodes have received the rumor. 
This draw is performed once for each neighbor. 
2. After all of the neighbors that can receive the rumor have been processed,
the collection of rumor spreaders is updated to include those nodes that received the rumor.
3. The total number of rumor spreaders and the number of new rumor spreaders are logged.
