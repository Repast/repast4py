The Zombies model is a predator-prey type model that illustrates the use of a 
continous space for movement and a discrete grid for neighborhood searches.
In the Zombies model, human agents are pursued by zombie agents, and once caught become
zombies themselves. Each timestep, the following occurs:

. All the Zombies:
  .. Query their immediate neighborhood to determine the adjacent grid location with
the most number of Humans
  .. Move towards that location, assuming any Humans are found
  .. Infect the Humans at that location, also assuming any Humans are found
. All the Humans:
  .. Become a Zombie, after being infected for more than 9 timesteps, else
  .. Query their immediate neighborhood to determine the adjacent grid location with
the fewest number of Zombies
  .. Move to that location at twice the speed of a Zombie.
